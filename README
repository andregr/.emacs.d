Notice: 

On the first run sometimes some downloads fail and require restarting
until everything succeeds. 

TODO:

Sometimes commands on init.el fail if they are run right after their 
package is installed, which also requires restarting.

Features:

* From: http://tim.dysinger.net/posts/2014-02-18-haskell-with-emacs.html
    ** No toolbars
    ** No local Emacs backups
    ** Pre-configured haskell-mode (cabal repl, ghc-mod, build on save, 
      error markers, get symbol type and info)
        *** Edited ghc-mod.rcp to remove flymake, since it creates annoying 
	  _flymake files. Just save to build - errors should be marked on 
	  the source.
* Better font for GUI mode on Linux
* Fix PATH on GUI mode on OS X
* Solarized theme (requires instalation first - M-X > el-get-install > solarized-theme)
