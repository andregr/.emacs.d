Features:

* From: http://tim.dysinger.net/posts/2014-02-18-haskell-with-emacs.html
    * No toolbars
    * No local Emacs backups
    * Pre-configured haskell-mode (cabal repl, ghc-mod, build on save, error markers, get symbol type and info)
        - Edited ghc-mod.rcp to remove flymake, since it creates annoying _flymake files. 
          Just save to build - errors should be marked on the source.
* Better font for GUI mode
* Solarized theme (requires instalation first - M-X > el-get-install > solarized-theme)
